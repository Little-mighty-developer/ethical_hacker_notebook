Brilliant pivot! 🎯 Framing Lesson 2 around **success** --- and using **DORA metrics** as actionable KPIs --- gives it clarity and resonance, especially for teams trying to measure what matters.

📘 Lesson 2: DORA Metrics --- The KPIs of Engineering Success
===========================================================

**"You can't improve what you don't measure --- but you can definitely mismeasure it."**

* * * * *

🧠 Start Here: What Does *Success* Look Like?
---------------------------------------------

Ask yourself:

-   How do you know your team is getting better?

-   Are your engineering metrics actually measuring *outcomes* --- or just *activity*?

-   What does *high performance* mean in a delivery team?

-   What gets celebrated? What gets reported?

If you're unsure, you're in the right place. This is where **DORA** helps teams replace gut feelings with real insight.

* * * * *

🧪 What Are DORA Metrics?
-------------------------

Developed by Google's DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team after 6+ years of research across 30,000+ teams, DORA metrics are **four key indicators** of software delivery performance.

| Metric | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Deployment Frequency** | How often you release to production | Higher = faster innovation |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | Time from code commit to deploy | Shorter = faster feedback |
| **MTTR** (Mean Time to Restore) | Time to recover from failure | Lower = more resilient systems |
| **Change Failure Rate** | % of deployments that cause problems | Lower = better stability |

* * * * *

🍩 Bakery Analogy --- DORA in the Kitchen
---------------------------------------

| Metric | Bakery Example |
| --- | --- |
| Deployment Frequency | How often you release new pastries to the storefront |
| Lead Time for Changes | Time from idea ("matcha croissant") to first customer bite |
| MTTR | How quickly you restock after discovering a burnt batch |
| Change Failure Rate | % of times a new recipe flops or gives customers stomach aches |

**Thinking question**:

> Are you iterating like a pop-up bakery or dragging like a frozen foods plant?

🔍 What to Measure & How to Evaluate
------------------------------------

### **1\. Deployment Frequency**

**What it tells you**: How fast your team delivers value.

✅ *High performers*: Deploy daily or even multiple times a day\
🚩 *Low performers*: Deploy once every few weeks/months

### ✅ How to Improve

-   Embrace trunk-based development (commit to a shared main branch daily or near-daily)

-   Shrink PR sizes

-   Automate tests and release steps

-   Decouple deployments from feature releases

* * * * *

### **2\. Lead Time for Changes**

**What it tells you**: How quickly you go from idea to value.

✅ *High performers*: Under 1 day\
🚩 *Low performers*: More than a week or month

### ✅ How to Improve

-   Reduce batch sizes

-   Visualize flow (Kanban, VSM)

-   Limit WIP and parallel work

-   Use feature flags

* * * * *

### **3\. Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**

**What it tells you**: How resilient you are under fire.

✅ *High performers*: Under 1 hour\
🚩 *Low performers*: More than a day

### ✅ How to Improve

-   Implement observability tooling

-   Use runbooks or AI-generated incident summaries

-   Encourage blameless postmortems

-   Practice chaos engineering

* * * * *

### **4\. Change Failure Rate**

**What it tells you**: The quality and safety of your delivery.

✅ *High performers*: 0--15%\
🚩 *Low performers*: 46%+

### ✅ How to Improve

-   Shift-left testing

-   Use automated rollback strategies

-   Implement peer reviews + linting

-   Track root causes by deployment, not team

* * * * *

🤖 AI in DORA
-------------

AI can help:

-   Suggest test cases before you ship

-   Detect regressions from logs or behavior

-   Flag PRs with risky patterns

-   Summarize incident trends by service

* * * * *

🧭 Wrapping Up: What Have You Learned?
--------------------------------------

✅ DORA metrics define software delivery success\
✅ High performance isn't about *speed alone*, but fast + safe\
✅ Each metric has a practical improvement path\
✅ AI can enhance, but not replace, strong practices

* * * * *

🚀 Try This
-----------

-   Ask your team: "What's *our* current DORA score?"

-   Run a quick retro: which of the 4 metrics are we weakest in?

-   Pick one to improve in the next sprint and track your impact
