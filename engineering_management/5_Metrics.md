📊 Key Terms: OKRs, KPIs, SLAs, SLOs, SLIs
==========================================

Understanding these acronyms will help you design goals, track performance, and negotiate expectations --- all essential for building resilient, aligned systems.

* * * * *

🎯 OKRs --- *Objectives & Key Results*
------------------------------------

**What it is:**\
A framework for setting **ambitious, qualitative goals (Objectives)** with **quantifiable outcomes (Key Results)**.

**Think of it like:**\
🧁 "We want to become the *#1 bakery in town* (objective) by *increasing daily croissant sales to 500*, *getting 100 5-star reviews*, and *expanding to 2 new locations* (key results)."

**Where it fits:**\
🌱 **Planning & alignment phase** --- helps teams focus their work and measure meaningful progress.

**Used by:**\
Engineering managers, product leads, DevOps leadership, startup founders.

* * * * *

📌 KPIs --- *Key Performance Indicators*
--------------------------------------

**What it is:**\
Metrics that track the **ongoing health or performance** of a system, team, or business objective.

**Think of it like:**\
🍩 "Daily donut sales" or "Average delivery time" --- critical for knowing if things are going well *right now*.

**Where it fits:**\
🌾 **Ongoing performance monitoring** --- helps you know if your processes are sustainable or slipping.

**Used by:**\
Analysts, product owners, operations teams, execs.

* * * * *

🤝 SLA --- *Service Level Agreement*
----------------------------------

**What it is:**\
A **formal commitment** to your users or customers --- "we promise X level of service, or we owe you something."

**Think of it like:**\
📦 "We guarantee 99.9% uptime --- or we'll refund your monthly fee."

**Where it fits:**\
🚨 **External contracts / client expectations** --- typically tied to business or legal agreements.

**Used by:**\
Sales, customer success, enterprise ops, external-facing teams.

* * * * *

🎯 SLO --- *Service Level Objective*
----------------------------------

**What it is:**\
A **goal** your team sets internally to meet your SLAs *without burning out*.

**Think of it like:**\
🏃‍♀️ "We aim for 99.95% uptime --- even though the SLA only requires 99.9%." It's your **internal target** that gives buffer for reliability.

**Where it fits:**\
🌱 **Site reliability engineering (SRE)** & system health design.

**Used by:**\
SREs, DevOps engineers, backend/platform teams.

* * * * *

🧪 SLI --- *Service Level Indicator*
----------------------------------

**What it is:**\
A **measurable metric** that tracks a specific aspect of system performance --- used to evaluate if you're hitting your SLOs.

**Think of it like:**\
📊 "The percentage of requests that return a 200 OK in under 500ms."

**Where it fits:**\
⚙️ **Monitoring + alerting layer** --- the data source used to power your reliability reports.

**Used by:**\
Engineering teams, monitoring platforms, SRE dashboards.
