📘 Lesson 3: DevOps vs. Platform Engineering
============================================

**"Same soul, different shoes."**\
Understanding the evolving relationship between DevOps culture and Platform Engineering practice.

* * * * *

🧠 Start Here: What's the Difference --- and Why Does It Matter?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Ask yourself:

-   Who owns the developer experience in your team?

-   What's the difference between culture-driven DevOps and product-minded platforms?

-   What *is* a platform, really --- and how do you know if yours is working?

-   Are your teams building features or infrastructure? Or both?

If you've ever felt like "DevOps" became a vague job title, or like your platform team is underappreciated --- you're not alone. Let's break it down.

* * * * *

🏗️ What Are DevOps & Platform Engineering?
-------------------------------------------

### 🛠 DevOps (in principle)

A **cultural movement** focused on breaking silos between Dev, Ops, and Security through collaboration, automation, and shared responsibility.\
**It's the why.** The mindset. The glue.

**Includes**:

-   CI/CD pipelines

-   CALMS framework

-   DORA metrics

-   Blameless culture

-   Fast feedback loops

* * * * *

### 🧱 Platform Engineering (in practice)

A **technical discipline** focused on building Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) --- reusable, self-service infrastructure and tooling.\
**It's the how.** The path. The scaffolding.

**Includes**:

-   Golden paths & paved roads

-   Platform as a product

-   Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

-   Developer Experience (DX)

-   SLOs and onboarding tooling

🍩 Bakery Analogy --- Who's Who in the Kitchen?
---------------------------------------------

| Role | Bakery Analogy |
| --- | --- |
| DevOps Team | Head chef team --- defines the culture, safety, and flow |
| Platform Engineers | Toolsmiths --- maintain ovens, timers, and automation rigs |
| Developers | Bakers --- create recipes and deliver pastries |
| Ops/SRE | Inspectors & fixers --- ensure ovens don't overheat or explode |

**Thinking question**:

> Is your bakery a free-for-all, or does it empower experimentation while ensuring food safety?

⚖️ Key Differences
------------------

| Feature | DevOps | Platform Engineering |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Origin | Culture & movement | Engineering discipline |
| Focus | Speed, feedback, collaboration | Internal tooling & enablement |
| Output | Practices, shared ownership | Infrastructure, portals, golden paths |
| Misconception | Just automation or "DevOps Engineer" roles | Just "infra team" with a new name |
| Measurement | DORA metrics (Lead time, MTTR) | Developer satisfaction, onboarding time |

* * * * *

🧠 What to Measure & How to Improve
-----------------------------------

### 🔍 DevOps-Centric Metrics

-   Lead Time for Changes

-   Deployment Frequency

-   Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)

-   Change Failure Rate

### 🔧 Platform-Centric Metrics

-   Time to onboard a new dev

-   % adoption of golden paths

-   Support tickets for infra issues

-   Internal NPS or developer satisfaction

### ✅ How to Improve

-   Define golden paths with input from dev teams

-   Automate onboarding and sandbox environments

-   Encourage internal feedback loops

-   Track time spent *building infra* vs *rescuing teams*

* * * * *

🤖 AI in DevOps vs. Platform Engineering
----------------------------------------

-   Generate reusable runbooks or Terraform templates

-   Summarize dev support tickets to uncover friction

-   AI assistants for onboarding new team members

-   Detect low adoption or inefficiencies in internal tools

* * * * *

🧭 Wrapping Up: What Have You Learned?
--------------------------------------

✅ The real difference between DevOps culture and platform engineering practice\
✅ Why they work best *together* --- one is mindset, one is scaffolding\
✅ How to apply metrics that reflect both speed *and* experience\
✅ How AI can support (not replace) your platform team's mission

* * * * *

🚀 Try This
-----------

-   Ask your team: "What internal tool do you dread using, and why?"

-   Map out your current golden path and who uses it

-   Pick 1 DevOps metric and 1 Platform metric to improve over 30 days
