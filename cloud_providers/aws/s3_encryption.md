🔐 Encryption in S3 --- Guarding the Treasure
-------------------------------------------

On our AWS island, encryption is like **magical locks on each treasure chest**. Even if someone steals the chest, they **can't open it without the key**.

### 🔄 Two Types of Encryption in S3

| Type | What it protects | Where it happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Server-Side Encryption (SSE)** | Data at rest (on disk) | AWS encrypts after upload |
| **Client-Side Encryption (CSE)** | Data before uploading | You encrypt before S3 sees it |

### 🏰 Server-Side Encryption (SSE)

S3 encrypts your object **after** receiving it, and decrypts it **when you download** --- all behind the scenes.

#### 🔑 SSE Options:

1.  **SSE-S3 (AES-256)**

    -   Managed by AWS.

    -   You don't bring any keys.

    -   Easiest and default for many workloads.

2.  **SSE-KMS (AWS Key Management Service)**

    -   You manage keys in AWS KMS.

    -   Enables audit trails, rotation, and fine-grained access.

    -   Recommended for sensitive workloads (e.g., finance, healthcare).

3.  **SSE-C (Customer-Provided Keys)**

    -   You bring the encryption keys on each request.

    -   AWS never stores the key.

    -   Advanced, but painful to manage securely.

### 🤐 Client-Side Encryption (CSE)

-   You encrypt the data yourself **before** sending it to S3.

-   Ideal if you don't trust AWS to handle keys --- but now **you're responsible** for key management, encryption logic, and decryption.

### 💡 Best Practices

-   ✅ Enable **SSE-KMS** for all sensitive data.

-   ✅ Use **bucket policies** to enforce encryption at upload (`"x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"`).

-   ✅ Enable **default encryption** on buckets --- it's easy and safe.

-   🚫 Don't roll your own crypto (unless you're a cryptography expert).

-   ✅ Audit your KMS key usage with CloudTrail.

### 🧠 Thinking Question

> Have you ever uploaded sensitive data to S3 without thinking about encryption?\
> What's your team's default stance --- "encrypt everything" or "encrypt when needed"?
