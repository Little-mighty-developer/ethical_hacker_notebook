🏝️ S3 --- The Island's Storage Vault
===================================

**"Where do we store all the treasure?"**

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is like your **billionaire island's warehouse** --- infinitely scalable, super durable, and surprisingly cheap.

* * * * *

💼 What Is S3?
--------------

-   S3 is AWS's **object storage** system --- ideal for storing **files**, **backups**, **media**, **logs**, and more.

-   Every file is called an **object** and is stored in a **bucket** (like a top-level folder).

🧠 Think of:

-   **Bucket** = Named storage locker (global name, unique like a domain)

-   **Object** = A file inside that locker

📦 S3 Core Concepts
-------------------

| Term | Island Analogy | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bucket** | Warehouse vault | Holds all your items (objects) |
| **Object** | A piece of treasure (file) | The actual data (video, doc, log, etc.) |
| **Key** | Name on the treasure box | Unique identifier (acts like a file path) |
| **Prefix** | Folder-like labels | Used for organizing/searching objects |
| **Region** | Which island you're storing in | Buckets are regional |
| **Versioning** | Time-travel for your files | Keeps old versions of objects |

* * * * *

🔐 Bucket Policies & Permissions
--------------------------------

S3 is **private by default** --- only you can see what's in your bucket.

You can control access via:

-   **Bucket Policies** (resource-based)

-   **IAM policies** (identity-based)

-   **ACLs** (Access Control Lists -- old, avoid if possible)

🛡️ Want to share an object with the public?\
→ Generate a **pre-signed URL** or adjust **bucket policy** carefully!

🏹 Storage Classes --- Choose Your Treasure Chest Wisely
------------------------------------------------------

| Class | Use Case | Durability | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Standard** | Frequently accessed files | 11 9's | 💰 |
| **IA (Infrequent Access)** | Backups, archives you *might* need | 11 9's | 💸 |
| **Glacier / Deep Archive** | Cold storage (tape-like!) | 11 9's | 🧊 |
| **One Zone IA** | Backup copies in a single AZ | Less | 💸💸 |

🧠 Think of Glacier as a **freezer vault** you need to thaw before opening.
