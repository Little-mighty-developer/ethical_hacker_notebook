# 🛡️ Ethical Hacker Notebook

Welcome to my Ethical Hacker Notebook — a living, evolving journal of everything I'm learning on my path to mastering cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and DevSecOps.

This is my personal lab, second brain, and roadmap for becoming a white hat hacker. It's a mix of hands-on practice, tool walkthroughs, theoretical concepts, and reflections from courses, CTFs, and real-world exercises.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository helps me:

- 📘 Organize and retain key cybersecurity concepts
- 🧪 Practice tools and attack/defense techniques legally
- ✅ Track my learning progress with GitHub Projects
- 💬 Reflect on wins, questions, and roadblocks
- 🧰 Build a public portfolio of real-world skills
