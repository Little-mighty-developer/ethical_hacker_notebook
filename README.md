# 🛡️ Ethical Hacker Notebook

Welcome to my Ethical Hacker Notebook — a living, evolving journal of everything I'm learning on my path to mastering cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and DevSecOps.

This is my personal lab, second brain, and roadmap for becoming a white hat hacker. It's a mix of hands-on practice, tool walkthroughs, theoretical concepts, and reflections from courses, CTFs, and real-world exercises.
